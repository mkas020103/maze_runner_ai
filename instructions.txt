Starting the Game
- After selecting a level, all players (the human player and three AI opponents) start at the same point.
- The human player moves first, followed by the AI players in sequence.

Player Navigation
- Mouse: Click on the path to move your character to the desired location.

AI Opponents
- Compete against AI players, each using a different search algorithm:
  - A\* Search: Efficiently finds the shortest path by balancing actual travel cost and heuristic estimates.
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Systematically explores all possible paths, ensuring the shortest path in terms of steps.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores paths deeply before backtracking, suitable for mazes with deep, singular paths.

Power-ups
While travelling along a path, you may encounter some power-ups:
- Blue Power-up: Teleports you to the shortest path leading directly to the finish line.
- Red Power-up: Randomly teleports you to a different location on the map, which could be advantageous or detrimental.
- Purple Power-up: Reveals the entire maze layout for 1 second, allowing you to plan your path. During this time, AI players can advance by one move.
